    <p>Lever is a dynamically typed programming language that pivots on malleability of itself.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Initial audience: Computer game developers, Virtual reality, 3D graphics. This is the audience we attempt to cater with optimizations and design decisions. Lever doesn't attempt to replace other languages in domains where they work better.</li>
        <li>Leverages RPython for implementation. Easier to improve and optimize than traditional programming languages.</li>
        <li>Built-in eventloop and greenlets. Results in asyncronous programs that are as simple as what synchronous code was.</li>
        <li>Customizable, extensible and hotswappable context free grammars. Allows to adjust the notation for the usecase.</li>
        <li>Foreign function interface. Uses formatted declarations. Wrappers around C libraries can be reused across programming languages.</li>
        <li>Multimethods with fixed arity. Avoids the gang of four pattern.</li>
        <li>Lever is MIT licensed, to acknowledge the good work put into PyPy that made it possible.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Lever 0.5.0 has been released in 31 December 2015.</p>
    <ul class="buttons">
        <li><a href="/doc/0.5.0/">Documentation (0.5.0)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/cheery/lever/">Source code in github</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Future plans for 1.0.0 will include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Eventual 3-platform support: Windows, OSX, SteamOS. (0.5.0 runs reliably in Linux systems)</li>
        <li>Out-of-the-box OpenGL 4 or Vulkan support.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Long term goal and policy of lever is that installation&amp;upgrade of any program should be "flip-a-switch" rather than "climb-the-everest".</p>
    <p>If you like to try this out, take a glance over the documentation.</p>
